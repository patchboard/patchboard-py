A Python client for Patchboard APIs

Install:

Install a python 2.7 environment (the nicest way to do this is with pyenv and
virtualenv).  It is developed under 2.7.7, and while it may work with earlier
versions that is currently untested. The goal is compatibility with at least
the 2.7 and perhaps the 2.6 series. If those versions don't fit your needs drop
us a line and we can talk about it.

Install patchboard-py from the cheese shop:

    $ pip install patchboard

or from the github repo:

    $ git clone git@github.com:patchboard/patchboard-py.git
    $ python setup.py install

or 'python setup.py develop' instead if you are planning to work on the
codebase itself.
